It takes a lot of effort before you gain a new customer. It is usually several interactions. So it is usually described as a journey. On every interaction customers need to find different content. They have different concern before sale, during sale negotiation, and when purchase was made.
To increase probability of accompany customers through the whole funnel, it is good to understand the stage, use appropriate tools to bring customer to the interaction and to the next stage. 

## Journeys

At each stage it is good to offer answers to specific questions. In the right order and at the right time. There are serveral stages which your prospects can go through. Typical stages can be like that:

1. Unaware
2. Awareness
3. Consideration
4. Evaluation
5. Purchase
6. Post-purchase
7. Advocacy

Not all potential customers go the whole journey. Sometimes they need other product, sometimes they do not find important information, sometimes some other problem occurs.
