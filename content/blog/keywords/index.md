### Target audience, keywords, and channels

### Popular on page metrics
* Density (% of keywords in indexable text) - Google no longer uses (2014)
* Frequency (frequent, but avoid stuffing)
* Prominence (keep it in the beginning)
* Proximity (keep keywords close)

> **How to calculate density**
> Density = ( Nkr / ( Tkn -( Nkr * ( Nwp-1 ) ) ) ) * 100
> 
> Density = your keyword density  
> Nkr = how many times a specific keyword is repeated  
> Nwp = number of words in the phrase  
> Tkn =  total words in the analyzed text
