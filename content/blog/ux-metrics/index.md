## Why is it important to measure UX?
It is not an easy discipline. Especialy in B2B SAAS. Customers are often busy and careful. They save their time and words. But there are several methods to derive maximum from minimum. Basical you can choose from observational and questionaire methods. Let us quickly summarize the most common ones.

## Goal Completion Rate
Goal Completion Rate (GCR) measures the number of visitors who have completed a specific goal on your website or mobile app. This metric is used by many digital marketers in two different ways. The first, and probably most familiar way is to measure conversions based on predefined goals (e.g. the end of the funnel), often using click behaviour. However, GCR can also be measured using customer feedback. Using this method, your visitors provide you with feedback regarding whether or not they’ve achieved their goal on your website. When a customer fails in reaching his/her goal on your website, you can ask them to leave their contact information behind, in which case they become a lead. With this information you are essentially given the opportunity to rectify the situation and help the customer convert.

## When To Use CES VS Other Customer Experience Metrics?
There are three main customer service metrics: Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and Customer Effort Score (CES). These metrics can complement each other, and your organization must experiment to understand which combination is right for you.

## Customer Effort Score
CES is an easy survey to deploy and track over time and is best for measuring customer loyalty. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always give the full picture and should be used in tandem with NPS. For instance, your customer may have a great relationship with your company but had a bad interaction this one time. If you only looked at CES you would think he wouldn’t be a loyalty customer, but that might not be the case.

## Net Promoter Score
NPS measures long-term loyalty and determines which customers are brand ambassadors and which could defect to other products. It looks at the entire relationship between the customer and the organization and is a great indicator of company growth. NPS can be used in concert with CES because while CES measure a single touchpoint, NPS is measured by the experience as a whole, including the product attributes, price, brand, and customer service altogether.

> Scale 1-10:  
> 1-7 - destractors  
> 8,9 - passives  
> 9,10 - promoters  
> 
> NPS = promoters - destractors / number of responses x 100

## Customer Satisfaction
CSAT measures the short-term happiness of your customers. It’s a versatile metric that allows you to ask a variety of questions about a single interaction or touchpoint. CSAT targets a “here and now” reaction to a specific interaction, product, or event, but it is limited when it comes to measuring a customer’s ongoing relationship with a company or loyalty.

## Customer Churn Rate (CCR)
Customer Churn Rate (CCR) is the number of customers between two time periods. Usually monthly or yearly. The advantage of this method is that you do not need to create any questionaire.
> Pros
> Helps to identify patterns in customer satisfaction
> Relates closely to revenue
> Very easy to benchmark
> Cons
> Doesn’t signal anything about the value of individual customers
> Attempts to reduce churn can cost more than the lifetime value of customers
> Can be tough for non-subscription businesses to track

General recommendations
- GCC - converting behavior
- CES - converting to customers potential
- CSAT - service satisfaction, loyalty potential
- NPS - loyalty
