## Why is it important to get customer feedback and measure UX?

Product must solve the customers' problem. Easily, effectively to make them satisfied. And when they are satisfied would they share their thoughts with others? If they do you can expect they will purchase repeatedly and bring new customers. Whose opinion could be more valuable then of those who bring money, new customers, and future potential for growth?

[Keneth Blanchart](https://howwelead.org/2015/01/07/feedback-is-the-breakfast-of-champions-2/) offers these reasons:

1. Understand what drives customers to your website
2. Understand what stops your customers from converting
3. Understand what persuades your customers to convert
4. Improve your product
5. Improve your website
6. Improve your sales and customer service
7. Measure customer satisfaction through customer feedback surveys
8. Build customer relationships and show you care
9. Improve customer retention
10. Fine-tune your pricing strategy
11. Understand your competition

## How to measure UX

It is not an [easy discipline](/how-to-get-feedback). Especially in B2B SAAS. Customers are often busy and careful. They save their time and words. But there are several methods to derive maximum from minimum. Basically, you can choose from observational and questionnaire methods. Let me quickly summarize the most common ones.

## Goal Completion Rate 

Goal Completion Rate (GCR) measures the number of visitors who have completed a specific goal on your website or mobile app. This metric is used by many digital marketers in two different ways. The first, and probably most familiar way is to measure conversions based on predefined goals (e.g. the end of the funnel), often using click behavior. However, GCR can also be measured using customer feedback. Using this method, your visitors provide you with feedback regarding whether or not they’ve achieved their goal on your website. When a customer fails in reaching his/her goal on your website, you can ask them to leave their contact information behind, in which case they become a lead. With this information, you are essentially given the opportunity to rectify the situation and help the customer convert.

## When To Use CES and When Other Customer Experience Metrics?

There are three main customer service metrics: Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and Customer Effort Score (CES). These metrics can complement each other, and your organization must experiment to understand which combination is right for you.

## Customer Effort Score

Customer Effort Score (CES) is an easy survey to deploy and track over time and is best for measuring customer loyalty. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always give the full picture and should be used in tandem with NPS. For instance, your customer may have a great relationship with your company but had a bad interaction this one time. If you only looked at CES you would think he wouldn’t be a loyalty customer, but that might not be the case.

## Net Promoter Score

NPS measures long-term loyalty and determines which customers are brand ambassadors and which could defect to other products. It looks at the entire relationship between the customer and the organization and is a great indicator of company growth. NPS can be used in concert with CES because while CES measures a single touchpoint, NPS is measured by the experience as a whole, including the product attributes, price, brand, and customer service altogether.

> Scale 1-10:  
> 1-7 - detractors  
> 8,9 - passives  
> 9,10 - promoters  
> 
> NPS = promoters - detractors / number of responses x 100

## Customer Satisfaction

Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) measures the short-term happiness of your customers. It’s a versatile metric that allows you to ask a variety of questions about a single interaction or touchpoint. CSAT targets a “here and now” reaction to a specific interaction, product, or event, but it is limited when it comes to measuring a customer’s ongoing relationship with a company or loyalty.

## Customer Churn Rate

Customer Churn Rate (CCR) is the number of customers between two time periods. Usually monthly or yearly. The advantage of this method is that you do not need to create any questionnaire.
> Pros
> Helps to identify patterns in customer satisfaction
> Relates closely to revenue
> Very easy to benchmark
> Cons
> Doesn’t signal anything about the value of individual customers
> Attempts to reduce churn can cost more than the lifetime value of customers
> Can be tough for non-subscription businesses to track

General recommendations
- GCR - converting behavior
- CES - converting to customers potential
- CSAT - service satisfaction, loyalty potential
- NPS - loyalty prediction
- CCR - loyalty behavior
