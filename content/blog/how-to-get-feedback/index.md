- customers.
- Opinion from outside
- Learn the trends
- How to improve products and services


## Why do they give feedback?

According to a whitepaper by TFM&A Insights, most customers give feedback because they want to express their opinion (64%). More specifically, they do so to let companies know where they were doing poorly (57%) or well (49%)

The wrong design
- too long, (try two to three questions)
- unclear purpose
- too personal

They think you don't care
- lack of customer care during product usage
They don't know what you're using it for
