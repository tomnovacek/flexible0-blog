## Design Thinking Process

Iterative process. You may pivot freely between stages.

### Understand users

Who is a user

Interviews
Observing

What they think and feel

Wider context of users - holistic and phenomenal approach. Their whole life. Individual experience. Understand the environment too.

Present users, latent users

Recommended questions and tasks:
- How the you complete this task? Why do you do what you do? Vocalize what is going through their minds during solving the problem.

What if the user does not exist yet?
